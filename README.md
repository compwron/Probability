Implement these user stories using TDD as though you mean it:

1.  I want to know if a coin flip resulted in a heads
2.  I want to know if a die rolled a '6'
3.  I want to know if one die results in a '6' and a coin flip is heads
4.  I want to know if one die results in a '6' or a coin flip is heads
